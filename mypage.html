	<p>People start doing photography (versus taking snaps or selfies) for many reasons. It might be a major life event coming up – new baby, wedding, special birthday – or that overseas trip saved up for over many years. It might be that the capabilities of your phone frustrate you enough to want to get real about photography. However it happens, suddenly you find yourself with an empty bank account and some form of camera gear that you now need to figure out how and where and maybe even, why to use it.</p>

<p>The essential purpose of photography is communication. Few people take pictures solely to please themselves. Most of us take them because we want them seen by others. ... Pictures are a photographer's means of expression as a writer's means are words.Generally, the purpose of visual images include images that inform, images that educate, images that persuade,images that entertain and etc. ... Here, the sample of 4 types images. IMAGES THAT INFORM. IMAGES THAT INFORM tell you something about the subject.Photography works to capture your memorable moments and make the biggest day or event memorable for the whole life. Photogenic snaps can create royal exposure of your beauty and enhancing your personality and save them to recognize your beloved peoples and events.Nowadays, photography is considered an art form as valid as any other, and there are multiple museums and galleries exhibiting photographic work. However, it wasn't so easy at the beginning, when photography was first invented, and photographers had a hard time being considered artists.Photography is both skill and talent. A skill, in my opinion, is something that is acquired from practice. A talent on the other hand is a naturally gifted ability to preform some sort of action. ... A proficient photographer might have accrued their ability by having a natural eye for composition or light.</p>
<h3>“The most important element of a good photo is the ability of the photograph to communicate with the viewer. It should be able to tell a story through its composition, lighting, and most importantly its subject matter.”</h3>
